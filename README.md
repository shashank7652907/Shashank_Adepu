## About Me

I’m an aspiring Embedded Systems Engineer with a strong foundation in C, Verilog, RTOS, and Embedded Linux. I specialize in firmware development, system debugging, and peripheral integration across microcontroller platforms like STM32, ESP32, and ARM Cortex-M.

I’m particularly interested in building real-time applications, working with low-level drivers, and designing efficient and reliable embedded systems.
